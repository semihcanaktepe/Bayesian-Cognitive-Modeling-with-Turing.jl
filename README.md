# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling with Julia and Turing
This repository includes the [Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Turing](https://turing.ml) implementation of the codes in Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2013).

**Codes and implementations are not complete. There are some models that I cannot get worked. Contributions are welcomed and appreciated.**
