# Bayesian Cognitive Modeling with Julia and Turing
This repository includes the [Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Turing](https://turing.ml) implementation of the codes in Bayesian Cognitive Modeling (Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2013).

## Notes:
* Codes and implementations are not complete yet.
* There are some models that I cannot get worked, or they simply do not replicate the results in the book.
* I will recover the models once I am done with building all the models in the book.
* Contributions are welcomed and appreciated.
